Hi There 

Iâ€™m looking at starting up an app/website which helps the homeless and in need to gain employment, from online tools to job agencies always updating the job register so that there is always something for someone.  
The app/website will also have such tools such as finding the closest food shelter and homes to sleep in, and will also have help so they can prepare themselves before working again.

Thanks

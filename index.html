	<article>
		<br>
<p>My Names Tom, im 30 and my story began in Sydney NSW where I was born and moved to Melbourne since I was 8 years old where I am still residing today.
.</p>
<br>
<p>I have been working full time in customer care roles basically ever since I finished high school which was back in 2007and have never had the courage to take the step into IT and follow my heart.
	<br>
I finally mustered the courage this year and I hope to expand my knowledge and learn as much as I can and would love to eventually down the track be working in the IT field.</p>
<br>
<p>Some of my hobbies are watching the AFL, Soccer and cricket, I also enjoy producing music on my PC as I used to DJ. I also enjoy watching some Anime and playing RPG games whenever I have the chance.</p>

	<div class="sectionTitle"><h3>Interest In IT</h3></div>
	<br>
	<p>I have always had a knack for computers ever since a young age even before I had the internet. I thought that Microsoft Encarta was the best thing since sliced bread and have evolved ever since then.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I have an interest in Gaming, Web development, and Apps which I am very new to as I have never previously studied IT anywhere before so this is all very new to me, but who knows where this will take me.</p>
	<br>
	<p>I hope to learn a variety of aspects in the IT world but especially App development and Web development as that is what I am mostly interested in .</p>
	<br>
	<p>I chose RMIT as it was a University that is close to where I reside, and have had people who advised me that it was a great school to go through to develop a career in IT.</p>

	<h2>Personality Profile</h2>
	<br>
		<img src="22.JPG" alt="Tom Kocovic" />
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>By considering all options before making actions I believe I can benefit working in a team by hearing everyone out before giving an answer and/or cutting someone off. </p>
		<p>This could also be taken the other way if I take too long to come to a conclusion.</p>
		<p>I can both be a listener but will have to keep putting input to the group conversations</p>

				<br>
<br>
		<p>By being a reflector I believe I can process what issues the group might be having with a project and come up with a thought out solution.</p>
		<p>People might think of this as being laid back so I will have to keep in constant contact with the group.</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<img src="gfff.jpg" alt="Tom Kocovic" />
		<br>
		<br>
		<p>By having a high work ethic and friendliness I believe I can gel with any team no matter what the situation.</p>
		<p>I believe with these traits it would help the work flow and synergy with my team.</p>

	<div class="sectionContent"><h2>Overview</h2></div>
	</article>
	<br>
	<p>I’m looking at starting up an app/website which helps the homeless and in need to gain employment, from online tools to job agencies always updating the job register so that there is always something for someone.  </p>
	<p>The app/website will also have such tools such as finding the closest food shelter and homes to sleep in, and will also have help so they can prepare themselves before working again.</p>

<div class="sectionContent"><h2>Motivation</h2></div>
</article>
<br>
<p>According to the 2016 census, homelessness has jumped by more than 16 percent in the 5 years from 2011 to 2016. The worst affected group is people between 19 and 34.</p>
<p>The Project is to lower the rate of homelessness hopefully by giving them a chance to get a job and provide for themselves or their family.</p>
<p>Homelessness and How old they are?</p>
<p>•	Under 12 14% (15,872) +11% since 2011</p>
<p>•	12-18 10% (10,913)</p>
<p>•	19-24 15% (15,325)</p>
<p>•	25-34 18% (19,312)</p>
<p>•	35-44 14% (14,484)</p>
<p>•	45-54 12% (12,507)</p>
<p>•	55-64 8% (8,649)</p>
<p>•	65-74 4% (4,174)</p>

<br>
<p>Starting off I have thought about producing an app/website that allows homeless people and people in need find employment and gain employment skills all through their palms or a pc.</p>
<p>The app will also provide beneficial services such as grooming and clothes for people in need. It will also provide home shelters and other services that may be sufficient for the homeless or in need.</p>
<p>The homeless also may find it hard to adjust from not working, and with things like alcoholism and drug use a big thing with homeless culture, we try and support them any means possible and try to provide them services and education so that they can start working and get there life back on track,</p>
<p>If they do not have a smart phone or PC these will be facilitated at job agency centres so that they may use it by any means and have another chance at life as they are struggling to find work in the situation they are in now. </p>
<p>We will also keep in contact with some employers and see how they are tracking and if they need any extra assistance or help to keep them going.</p>
<p>We will have this running on all platforms so that no one is left behind and have it on Google play as well as IOS app stores. This will also be integrated on the Web so that it is easily accessible.</p>
<p>To get the ball rolling I will have start with a project team so we can organise every aspect of the business as there will be a lot of different side facilities within the App/website.</p>
<p>We will need to be able to code for apps as well as HTML and CSS so that the project can run seamlessly. Data will be a major aspect of this project so I will l need skilled data engineers to create the most efficient databases and repositories possible. </p>
<p>A well-designed database will lead to a smoother, better performing app. Security will also be a major factor so You need your customers’ protected from compromise, and all the logs, checks, and balances in place.</p>
<p>Referred to as UI/UX, these skills are incredibly important for the end-user’s satisfaction as this app/Website has to be easy enough for anyone to use especially the elderly.</p>

<div class="sectionContent"><h2>Technologies</h2></div>
</article>
<br>
<p>The hardware and software needed to build the app/Webpage are HTML for web programing development and any text input that you need to add. You would also need CSS to modify the webpage built from HTML to adjust anything that needs attention and add any additional modifications.</p>
<p>I would also need to source job agency databases and implement them into the app/Webpage and any other relevant sources that may be useful.</p>

<div class="sectionContent"><h2>Skills Required</h2></div>
</article>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Product Management</h3>
<p>The product manager for a mobile app developer is a major liaison between the project team and the client to make the process run smoothly.
</p>
<br>
<h3>User Interface and User Experience</h3>
</p>Referred to as UI/UX, these skills are incredibly important for the end-user’s satisfaction.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Design</h3>
<p>Design simply refers to the overall look and feel of the app.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<p>You want your app developers to be on the same page as you. And every member of their team must be on the same page, too.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Modern Coding Languages</h3>
<p>Since mobile is the technology of the future, you don’t want an app developer stil coding in the past.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Cross-Platform Capabilities</h3>
</p>Whether you want to start your app on Android, iOS, or Windows, any successful app will eventually want to be ported into the other two.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Data Expertise</h3>
<p>Data drives apps. Data defines customers. Data is both what you’ll collect and how you’ll recognize your end-results. You need that data. Lots of it. Which means you’ll need skilled data engineers to create the most efficient databases and repositories possible. A well-designed database will lead to a smoother, better performing app.
</p>
<br>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>You need your customers’ privacy secured, your systems protected from compromise, and all the logs, checks, and balances in place.
</p>
<br>
<div class="sectionContent"><h2>Outcome</h2></div>
</article>
<br>
<p>I was hoping that with help from the government, Centrelink and a few other sources, I may be able to get the project up and running and help hundreds if not thousands of Australians wide and hopefully help a few people in the process of transitioning there life for the better.</p>
